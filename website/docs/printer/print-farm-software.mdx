# Print Farm Software

Creator Administrator is not intended to send GCODE to 3D printers. You should use dedicated hard- and software to 
efficiently manage your 3D print farm.

Creator Administrator has succesfully been tested in combination with
[fdm-monster](https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster).
