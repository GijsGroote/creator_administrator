# Tutorial - General

In this General tutorial examples will be given in de 3D printer application.

## Creating Jobs
There are three methods to create jobs; import from mail, select files or select folders.

### Import from Mail
Search the default inbox for mails that contains the accepted extensions (you can modify the accepted extensions in the settings). If there exists a mail that contains an attachment with an accepted extension, a dialog will open where you can check and confirm to create a job.

### Select Files
Create a job with files that are stored locally on the computer.


### Select Folder
Creating multiple jobs with files that are stored locally on the computer or via USB stick. Make sure to select a \<FOLDER\> that contains subfolders that contain the files to make:

```bash
└───<FOLDER>
      ├───<SUBFOLDER_1>
      │  ├───file
      │  └───another_file
      └───<SUBFOLDER_2>
             ├───file
             └───another_file
```

:::note note

No automatic mails will be send when creating jobs with the select files or select folder methods. This is because the is no email adress collected when creating the jobs.

## Moving Around

To walk through jobs use the arrow keys or the VIM key-bindings h, j, k, l, Ctrl+n and Ctrl+p.

| Key / Shortcut | Action |
|--------|-----------------|
| Arrow down, j, Ctrl+n | Move one job down |
| Arrow up, k, Ctrl+p | Move one job up |
| Arrow left, h | Move to the left |
| Arrow right, l | Move to the right |

:::tip tip

If you really want to be fast in handling job request, use the VIM keybindings, avoid the arrow keys, this is the way.
